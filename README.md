# Product-API

A continuation of a previous frontend project. Now I have build an API which feeds the page the products instead of the blob of JSON as it did before.  

You are also able to add products to the page through a new form which handles the POST requests to the API. 

There is also error handling to the React frontend so it shows an error message when the API isn't running.

Tech: HTML, CSS, React, Node, Express, MongoDB
